Shows previews of linked articles on Wikipedia pages.

When you hover a link to another article on Wikipedia, a small pop-up will show you the title section of that article.
You can customize:
	* the time you have to hover a link to show the preview
	* the color theme of the preview
	* font-size and transparency of the preview

The add-on itself does not collect any data. Note however, that the article previews are queried form Wikipedia in a separate query each time you hover over a link long enough.
